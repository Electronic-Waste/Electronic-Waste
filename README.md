This is Electronic-Waste😎, aka. **Shao Wang**, a freshman graduate 🧑‍🎓 at SJTU majoring in Computer Science.

Currently, I'm pursuing CS PhD opportunities in North America for 27fall, with a research focus on **Machine Learning System**.

I'm also an enthusiast for the open-source community, serving as:

- Maintainer of [SJTU-SE](https://github.com/SJTU-SE): An unofficial organization for the School of Software Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

- Reviewer of [kubeflow/trainer](https://github.com/kubeflow/trainer): Distributed ML training and fine-tuning on Kubernetes, subproject of [kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow).

- Reviewer of [kubeflow/katib](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib): An AutoML toolkit on Kubernetes, subproject of [kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow).

- Reviewer of [kubeflow/sdk](https://github.com/kubeflow/sdk): Kubeflow SDK for ML experience.

By now, I've accumulated some industrial experience related to **Cloud Native AI/Storage Systems**:

- Cloud @[Databend](https://github.com/databendlabs): Author of [Databend Operator](https://github.com/databendcloud/databend-operator), engaged in the development of on-premise cloud platform.

- GSoC'24 @[kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow): Optimize the control plane of [katib](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib), providing an SDK interface for push-based metrics collection.

- Infra @[BondiTech](https://bonditech.com.cn/): Build a new quote storage system on Kubernetes in replace of the current CSV-based storage system.
