### Hi there 👋

This is Electronic-Waste😎, aka. **Shao Wang**, a freshman graduate 🧑‍🎓 at SJTU majoring in Computer Science.  

I'm an enthusiast for the open-source community, serving as:

- Maintainer of [SJTU-SE](https://github.com/SJTU-SE): An unofficial organization for the School of Software Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

- Reviewer of [kubeflow/katib](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib): An AutoML toolkit on Kubernetes, subproject of [kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow).

- Reviewer of [kubeflow/training-operator](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator): Distributed ML training and fine-tuning on Kubernetes, subproject of [kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow).

By now, I have accumulated some professional experience related to **Cloud Native AI/Storage Systems**:

- GSoC'24 @[kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow): Optimize the control plane of [katib](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib), providing an SDK interface for push-based metrics collection.

- Infra @BondiTech: Build a new quote storage system on Kubernetes in replace of the current CSV-based storage system.

As for my future career life, my dream is to become an infrastructure engineer designing **Cloud Native AI/Storage Systems** with scalability, robustness, and high performance.
